	    Data is being produced faster than it can be stored.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    So, data stored should be &quot;worth its weight,&quot;
	  </li>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and how it's stored should reflect its natural structure,
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    in addition to expectations on how it will be used.

	  <h3>Where is most data stored?</h3>	
  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Digital storage formats are relatively young (from around 1950),
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    but by capacity, these overtook analog in 2002,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and by 2007, 94% of all data was stored in digital formats,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    with more than half of this present on disks.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    The rate at which data is produced is growing exponentially,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and by 2011, only half of that produced had a permanant home.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    So, while the cost of digital storage is always going down,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    space will always be at a premium
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and the data we store should be chosen carefully,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    with its growing size motivating storage for efficient access.
	  </li>

	  <h3>Too many disks.</h3>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    So now and going forward, most data is stored on disk,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    but with personal data constantly growing, we should ask:
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    how many TBs is my digital footprint,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and how much disk space should I keep physically?
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Hard drives are getting cheaper, but portability comes at cost,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    with risks for damage in transit or loss.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    This is why networks and the cloud exist, but what is the cloud?
	  </li>	  
	  
	</section>

	<section>
	  <h3>What is the cloud?</h3>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Is cloud data actually stored ephemerally in space? NO!
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    A cloud is just a system of disks on servers networked to you.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Most likely, your cloud is distributed across multiple drives,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    possibly in a warehouse in Chicago or deep <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2014/12/01/seagate-moves-into-iron-mountains-underground-data-center/">underground</a>!
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    As digital footprints become larger, more will be cloud-based,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    convenient for access and the security of data redundance.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Is personal data safe in the cloud? There are many opinions,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and digital footprint safety is perhaps just as important.

	  <h3>Storage systems</h3>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Generally, on a machine there is some type of file system.
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    When storing files, it is best to be consistent and organized.
	  </li>	  
	  <br>
	  <ul>
	    <li class='fragment'> Some good-hygiene practices:
	      <ul>
		<li class='fragment'>
		  Keep code in separate directories from data.
		</li>
		<li class='fragment'>
		  Don't put too many files in one directory.
		</li>
		<li class='fragment'>
		  Organize files into directories by their contents.
		</li>
		<li class='fragment'>
		  Don't replicate files for multiple uses&mdash;just link!
		</li>
		<li class='fragment'>
		  If it doesn't get used often, compress a file.
		</li>
                                    <li class='fragment'>
                                      Delete intermediates, use a pipeline
                                    </li>
	      </ul>
	    </li>
	  </ul>

	<!--     A file system is about as basic as it gets for access. -->

	<!--   <li class='fragment'> -->
	<!--     Staying low-level is great for portability, but not necessarily access. -->
	<!--   </li> -->
	  
	<!--   <li class='fragment'> -->
	<!--     Let's think about medical records. -->
	<!--   </li>	   -->

	<!--   <li class='fragment'> -->
	<!--     It's perfectly reasonable to store each patient in a separate directory, -->
	<!--   </li> -->

	<!--   <li class='fragment'> -->
	<!--     with each visit a record in a separate file. -->

	  <h3>Storage formats</h3>
	  <!-- <li class='fragment'> -->
	  <!--   Moving on from the vague generalities of modern data stoage, -->
	  <!-- </li>	   -->
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Let's go over some common data formats that exist in the wild.
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Most file types have associated a file extension, e.g., .txt,
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    but these simply indicate format type, are aren't necessary.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    While there is no such thing as &quot;plain text&quot; (recall <a href="ch03.html#/9">utf-8</a>),
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    with a text file (.txt) there is no expectation of structure;
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    there might be different data inside (e.g., text and numbers),
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    but with no guarantee of presence or placement in file.
	  </li>

	</section>

	<section>
	  <h3>Text files&mdash;can you find the structure?</h3>

	<section>
	  <h3>Ordered arrays</h3>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    These are perhaps the simplest form of structured data.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Matrix arrays (2D, e.g., .csv or .tsv) have rows and columns,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    which rigidly assume all rows have the same width.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    This make ordered arrays dense data objects,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    both in storage and in memory while programming.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Header labels generally indicate column contents.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Important: it's best to have columns as attributes of rows!
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    I.e., each row should be an independent &quot;record.&quot;
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Why? Files are read left to right, from top to bottom.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    If each column were a record (bad), 
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    the whole file would have to be read before processing.
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    This has severe memory implications when handling large data.
	  </li>

	  <h3>Associative arrays</h3>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    A simple array ordering isn't always appropriate data structure.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Vectors are dense&mdash;you have to be consistent with columns.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Suppose a scientist is gps tracking Koala bears,
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and along with names and ages, they record lat-lon sequences.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    The earlier-tagged animals will have more data points,
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and the longer the experiment is run, the more points will exist.
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    In order to store each Koala as a record, we need flexibilty.
	  </li>

	</section>

	<section>
	  <h3>Associative arrays</h3>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Associative arrays are characterized by key-value pairs.
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    A common encoding is Javascript Object Notation (.json),
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and programming languages have assoicative array objects.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    A key is just a name for access, a value can be anything,
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and they can next data heirarchically.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    In our example, each Koala could be its own associative array.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Keys for name, age, etc., provide access to text and numbers,
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    but now a key &quot;locations&quot; values a vector of coordinates,
	  </li>	  

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and the lists can be different sizes!
	  </li>	  

	</section>

	<section>
	  <h3>Associative arrays (JSON)</h3>
	  
	  <center>	    
	    <img src="./images/koalas.json.png" alt=" " style="width: 80%;max-height: 100%;object-fit: contain;Float: center" />
	  </center>
	  
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <h3>Schemas</h3>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Associative arrays are well-characterized by flexibility,
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    but to be navigable, should have consistent structure.
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    I.e., each record should have a consistent form, or schema.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    In our example, each record had three and only three fields,
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and while flexible, values were consistently in place.
	  </li>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Suppose now that the scientist wished to track joeys,
	  </li>
	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    and that not all koalas have had any children.
	  </li>

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    good data hygiene in a new &quot;children&quot; field 
	  </li>	  

	  <li class='fragment'>
	    might reserve &quot;null,&quot; or an empty array for non-parents.
	  </li>	  

	</section>
	
	<section>
	  <h3>Relational databases</h3>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    The schema concept goes beyond files and program objects.
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Relational databases are whole storage &amp; retrieval systems.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    They are based around tables of records linked by keys.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Key-links between tables make regular access efficient.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    E.g., link a doctor's record to each of their patients',
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    These systems also simplify joins and set operations for data.
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Common implementations include SQL, Oracle, and SAP.
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    Many are proprietary, but a good number are open and free.

	  <h3>OLTP vs. OLAP</h3>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    High-level data access systems categorize into two groups.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    On-line Transaction Processing (OLTP), for operational actions.
 	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    On-line Analytical Processing (OLTP), for intelligence insights.
	  </li>	  
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    They are often both built from relational database systems,
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    but value different features.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    OLTP elevates integrity and uptime for quick, reliable access.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    E.g., adding/updating/deleting a record for a customer.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    OLAP elevates access to certain aggregations for analysis.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    E.g., purchase histories across all customers.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    OLAPs are often called data warehouses, and are denormalized.
	  </li>
	  <li class='fragment'>
	    I.e., data may exist redundantly for analytic convenience.
